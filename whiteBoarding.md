What excites you about coding?

I enjoy the building aspects of it.
Array index and Array value.

the index is the position of the value's element
and value is what the array variable is defined as 

iteration is the process of repeating an action until a certin criteria is met


Mixed data type arrays
Create a function that takes in an array 
Returns array with only values

Create the function = onlyStrings
with a parameter of array 
iterate through an array and return only strign data type
const mixedArr = [
    "hello", 5, true, "Makiah", 0, "Jose"
]
const onlyStrings = (array) => {
    if(array.typeOf === string)[
        return array 
    ]

}
